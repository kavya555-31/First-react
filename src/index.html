Create an input box where a user can type some text (for example, a task or an item name). 
Create a button labeled "Add Item". When the button is clicked, a function named addItem() should run. 
This function must: 
        Read the text entered in the input box. 
        If the input is not empty, create a new <li> element and add it to an existing unordered list <ul>. 
        If the input is empty, display an alert message: "Please enter some text". 
        After successfully adding the item, clear the input box so the user can type another entry. 
        With every added task there should be a delete button to remove the task as well -->
